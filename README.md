# <Logicraft_>

A Minecraft: Java modpack!

## About

This modpack is built around the idea of using _logic_ to control the world
around you! Utilize many machines and computers to generate everything you need
autonomously! Make sure to remember your edge cases so things don't backup on
you when you least expect it.

This is a custom-made modpack that my friends and I play on a server I host at
home. This modpack's focus is our entertainment. It may undergo vast
periods of time with little attention. It is released publicly only so that it
is easy for my friends to install using the Twitch launcher and is not generally
expected to be a popular public pack like FTB. But, please feel free to
contribute if you find issues!

## Changelog

I maintain a separate changelog documenting changes for each version of the modpack. Please checkout [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) to view this.

## Contributing

Open a pull request to report any issues. Please include as much detail as
possible including screenshots if appropriate! PRs lacking effort may be ignored
(closed) without response.
