# Q: WHAT IS THIS?
# A: This file is used to store all the keywords you can use to create item rules, but also to define the items order.
# You can move/change all that you want, but it's recommended not to delete any default item.

# Q: MY CUSTOM FILE WAS REPLACED =(
# A: Since a new major version of Minecraft appeared, I silently updated the tree... BUT!
# I kept a backup of your version in the same directory. Sorry for the trouble, feel free to import your changes in the new file.

# Q: THE FILE IS BROKEN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO =(
# A: Just delete this file, the default tree will be reloaded next time you sort something!

# This is the modded minecraft tree.  There may be a newer version available at
# https://github.com/IMarvinTPA/inventory-tweaks/tree/develop/src/main/resources/assets/inventorytweaks
# Help on maintaining and expanding the tree is welcomed, please contact IMarvinTPA.

# CREDITS
# Thanks to Larandar & Lunaqua for their contributions.
# IMarvinTPA for the modded tree.
