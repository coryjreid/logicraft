# Focus on automating all the things
{: .fs-9 }

Logicraft gives you all the tools you need to generate infinite resources to be able to acquire all the end-game things.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

This pack is designed to give you powerful tools to quickly start automating production of resources. Your goal should be to acquire the minimum resources needed to begin this process, and then progressively increase the amount and quantity of items you're producing until you can attain the end-game gear of your choice!

There are a number of technology mods in the pack to allow you to choose your own adventure such as:

- Thermal Series of mods
- Mekanism
- Botania

Typically people choose to chase the armor of Botania or Mekanism. You can combine these systems in any way you desire, or explore each as an individual entity. The choice is yours!
