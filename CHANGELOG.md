# Version 3.4.7

The majority of these updates are centered around ore generation. It was discovered that Aluminum and Dimensional Shards were not generating (or struggling to generate). Most fixes are related to these fixes.

These oregen changes separate the ores into more distinct spawning layers. The goal is to hopefully allow each mineral type to have increased spawning chance without forcefully bumping rates. You can view our [ore configuration](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s2UInXcfo180PBI2JcHAOAfNMPe-dR5VdotWcSLWJN0/edit?usp=sharing) for more info.
